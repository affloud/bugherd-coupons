**BugHerd** is a visual feedback and bug tracking tool made for website teams. It helps you collect feedback by letting clients and teammates click on any part of your website and leave a comment. BugHerd turns that feedback into a task, complete with screenshots, browser info, and more. This saves time and avoids confusion from long email chains or unclear messages.

It’s great for web developers, designers, and agencies who want a faster, clearer way to work with clients or team members. BugHerd is easy to use, works right inside your website, and connects with tools you already use like Jira, Trello, Slack, and ClickUp.

## BugHerd Features

**Visual Feedback**

BugHerd lets users click anywhere on a website to leave feedback. The comment gets pinned directly to the selected element, making it clear exactly where the issue is. This saves time and avoids the confusion that often comes with vague email feedback or screenshots.

**Automatic Task Creation**

Each piece of feedback automatically turns into a task. BugHerd collects useful details like browser type, screen size, and a screenshot with every task, so your team doesn’t have to chase clients for extra info.

**Kanban-Style Task Board**

</a>

BugHerd includes a built-in task board that looks and works like Trello. Tasks can be assigned, prioritized, and moved through different stages, helping you keep your workflow organized without needing another tool.

**Video and Audio Feedback**

</a>

Users can record their screen and voice to report issues more clearly. This is especially helpful when the problem is hard to describe or when the person giving feedback isn’t comfortable writing it all out.

**Works on Live and Staging Sites**

</a>

You can install BugHerd on both live and staging websites. This makes it easier to collect feedback during testing or after the site is published, without switching platforms or tools.

**Collaboration and User Roles**

BugHerd lets you add teammates, clients, and freelancers to your project. You can set different permission levels, so only the right people see or change certain tasks.

**Easy Integrations**

BugHerd works with many popular tools like Jira, Trello, ClickUp, Slack, and GitHub. You can sync tasks between tools, so your team can keep using the apps they already know and like.

**Browser Extension**

</a>

BugHerd has a Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension. This lets you start collecting feedback right away, even without adding any code to your website—perfect for quick tests or when you don’t have access to the site’s backend.

**Design File Feedback**

You can upload Figma files, images, and PDFs to BugHerd. Clients and teammates can leave comments on these files just like they would on a live site, which is great for reviewing designs before development begins.

**Client-Friendly Interface**

BugHerd is designed to be easy for anyone to use. Clients don’t need any training or technical knowledge, and they can even leave feedback without creating an account if you allow guest access.
